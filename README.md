#### Typography
- Eye-catching 'Sacramento' font for a warm, stylish feel.

<!-- or 
Font Choice: 'Sacramento' font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sacramento?query=sacra) was chosen to create an impact on the overall readability and style of the text. 'Great Vibes' and 'Raleway' were also selected for styling. 'Sans-serif' was selected as a backup font.

Font Size: A font size that is comfortable to read was used. Headings and subheadings may have larger font sizes to distinguish them from body text.

Formatting: Options such as bold, italics, and code blocks to highlight important information or code snippets were used. 

Line Spacing: Proper line spacing to enhance readability is used. 

Hierarchy: Appropriate use of headings and subheadings create a clear hierarchy in the site. This helps readers quickly identify different sections and understand the structure of the content.

Consistency: A consistent style is maintained throughout the site lending itself to a professional and polished appearance.
