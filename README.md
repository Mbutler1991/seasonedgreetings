Please view the Seasoned Greetings live project [here.](https://mbutler1991.github.io/seasonedgreetings/)

### Problem Statement
As a user I want to be able to search recipes with a powerful filtering capacity to accomodate my preferences.

### Objective(s)
The main objective is to create a website that allows users to search for holiday recipes.  
<!-- elaborate on functionality of api as features and achievementsonce it is up and running --> 

## Criteria
In this section, we will briefly discuss how our team addressed the applicable criteria:
- The front-end only criteria limited the scope for publishing a recipe rating system and database.  
- Publishing recipes in a blog also became problematic. 
<!-- HELP WITH THIS PLEASE -->

## User Stories
As a user I want to be able to search for holiday recipes using filters so that I can download them.
<!-- printing and emailing would also be great -->

### Target Audience
- The target audience is the global citizen.  People across the globe can use this website regardless of religion, culture, dietrary constraints, lifestyle choices and ingredient limitations. 
- Consideration was given to present the holiday spirit in a generic, commercial tone to promote inclusivity.

## Features
###  The project goes beyond the requirements of the assigned task
- The website is designed in such a way that it is future-proofed for scalability by keeping a basic structure that can easily be expanded and made more complex.
- An API link to gives the user a broad scope to filter recipes from.

<!-- Insert link for API and highlight some features from the API choice --> 

###  Existing Features
- The website was designed with responsive design for mobiles, laptops, and desktops.

## Ideas For Future Features
<!-- pull from the section on project board once MVP is established -->

### Design
#### Color Scheme
<!-- get from Emily once finalised -->

#### Typography
Font Choice: This font was chosen to create an impact on the overall readability and style of the text. 
<!-- insert image and choice -->

Font Size: A font size that is comfortable to read was used. Headings and subheadings may have larger font sizes to distinguish them from body text.

Formatting: Options such as bold, italics, and code blocks to highlight important information or code snippets were used. 

Line Spacing: Proper line spacing to enhance readability is used. 

Hierarchy: Appropriate use of headings and subheadings create a clear hierarchy in the site. This helps readers quickly identify different sections and understand the structure of the content.

Consistency: A consistent style is maintained throughout the site lending itself to a professional and polished appearance.

#### Wireframes
<!-- INSERT WIREFRAME image and reference in Credits below -->

###  Project is 100% Front-end
<!-- is this even a heading, got it from the example but will discard unless justified -->

### Future Features
A search with ingredients could enable:
- zero waste, a current culinary trend.
- multi-cultural dining opportunities by providing alternatives for example, Halaal, Kosher, or Jainism.
- locally sourced ingredients to minimize carbon footprint. 
- personal preferences as an alternative to accommodate food intolerances, allergies and healthier alternatives.
- make following nutritional lifestyles easier for example, Palio, Keto, and Mediterranean.
- economical cooking is made easier!
